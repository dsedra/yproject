Inbox messages will inexplicably appear to be blank and if you get a blank one (seems random as to which ones disappear) you'll never get to see on the app. It's forever blank. Gotta go to a computer to see it. Messages appear to be filed in the wrong folders and often can't be read unless you use search to find out where they are secretly stashed. Sad.

After using this app for a week I've noticed my battery performance has plummeted - please give me the ability to set a sync schedule. I love getting Yahoo! notifications, but the active push utilizes entirely too much active CPU process.  Compared to my general Mail app, Yahoo! Mail for Android is a life stealer.
