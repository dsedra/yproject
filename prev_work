Subjectivity Word Sense Disambiguation (Akkaya, Wiebe 2009)
	- subjectiviy word sense disambiguation (swsd): automatically determine which word instances
	are being used with subjectivity senses vs. objective
	- 
Recognizing Contextual Polarity in Phrase-Level Sentiment Analysis (Wilson, Wiebe, Hoffmann 2009)
	relevant ideas:
		- methods for distinguishing prior and contextual polarity
		- two steps:
			1. classify phrases as neutral or polar
			2. then classify as positive, negative, neutral, both ()
		- manually annotated
		- neutral/polar features:
			- three word bag of words
			- modification: preceded by adjective/adverb, modified by strongsubj/weaksubj
			- structure features: relations based on dependency tree
		- polarity classifier features: 
			- word pror polarity
			- negated or not
			- modifies polarity
			- general polarity (reverse polarity)
			- positive/negative shifters


Integrating Knowledge for Subjectivity Sense Labeling (Gyamfi, Wiebe, Mihalcea, Akkaya 2009)
	relevant ideas:
		- methods for assigning subjectivity labels to word senses focusing on NOUNS
		- exploit vertical taxonomic links instead of just horizontal
		- two steps:
			1. identify subjective words
			2. disambiguate their senses
		- domain specific features 
		- features:
			- similarity between target sense and subjective seed set, info. associated
			w/ their Least Common Subsumer, WordNet Domains used to particularize to domain
			- domain subjectivity
			- senses related to target and senses in seed set

		- ablation studies good for showing effectiveness of individual features


Word Sense and Subjectivity (Wiebe, Mihalcea 2006)
	- main questions:
		1. can word senses be labelled with subjectivity?
		2. can subjectivity help improve word sense disambig.?	
	- used the Distributionally Similar Words based on the parsed Brit. Nat. Corpus
	- calculaate a subjectivity score as sum of similarity scores for words in DSW
	- also used given w and DSW, subj. score = cond. prob. that any member of DSW is in 
	subj. expression
	- could use a role of senses in improving subjectivity simultaneously



Initial plan:
	1. sentiment classification
		- seperate data into positive, negative, neutral, and both classifications
		- possibly use existing tool for process
		- 
	2. subjectivity analysis
		- annotate with appropriate WordNet synset and then look up
		- information extraction
		- clustering using most frequent subjective words as features
