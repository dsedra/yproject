TODO notes

Objectives:
	1. to distill sentiment about user feedback from comments/reviews
	2. use subjectivity analysis to get at common themes and root causes of sentiment
	3. to return results that prioritize actionable areas, i.e. 
		- find problems
		- feature requests
		- good features




Ideas/Approaches:
	- Brown clustering: 
		- after splitting into 
	- neural networks:
		- could use supervised (review,rating) to generate a function
		- unsupervised can be used in clustering
	- naive Bayes classifier:
	- classify the sentences into (pos,neg,neut,both) then work on clustering them into catagories, special work for the both ones


Features:
	- words and pos/neg score from SentiWordNet 3.0
	- common words across a cluster
