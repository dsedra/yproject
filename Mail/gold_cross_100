This new version was very good application. I recommend! &&*%*&& pos
No iPad platform? Terrible. &&*%*&& neg
This app is good. Better than most mail apps. But far inferior to the native iOS mail. I fail to see the need for this yahoo mail client. The native app benefits from iOS push notification, which are near instant as well as the notification center. It allows the user to see and access his custom folders and do almost everything he can from a PC browser. &&*%*&& both
Their needs to be a way to easily delete spam &&*%*&& neut
Not every network allows access to my emails through my iphone mailbox.  This is the perfect app that I have been waiting for. I can always access my yahoo mail easily without any restrictions on networks that I am connecting to. &&*%*&& pos
This app is great. I just wish it had an option for VIP mail alerts like the iPhone mail app. If it did, I would give it 5 stars. &&*%*&& both
Great app.  A very good start &&*%*&& pos
I finally succumbed to incessant pressure to install the damned thing even though I did not ask for it or want it. And I hate when Yahoo blocks the bottom section of iPhone formatted articles so that it is impossible to view the desktop version. It is okay I guess...but I hate HATE being badgered to download stuff I do not ask for. &&*%*&& neg
Quick and easy to use! &&*%*&& pos
Thanks yahoo for this app finally u decided to have a great app. Easy, simple and fast. &&*%*&& pos
