Very useful and simple. &&*%*&& 
An excellent application of e-mail, easy, lightweight, intuitive and fast! &&*%*&& 
Good APP with it you can access multiple accounts from Yahoo, with more facilities than the web, I recommend it. &&*%*&& 
While there is no possibility to mark several mails at once, you can not evaluate as well ... &&*%*&& 
Fast and well structured! &&*%*&& 
Fast &&*%*&& 
Very good this app, much better than the application of native email on the iPhone. &&*%*&&

It was time that was the will of yahoo mail for iOS, now you just need the yahoo answer on iOS! &&*%*&& 
User friendly. Can be faster to load. &&*%*&& 
Very top the app, practical and objective. &&*%*&& 
Well efficient and lightweight &&*%*&& 
Great app! Loads e-mail faster than mail, easier to navigate between folders... &&*%*&& 
Very Good &&*%*&& 
who would say, pleasantly surprised. &&*%*&& 
Fast and practical. &&*%*&& 
Great app, easy and very useful in everyday life. &&*%*&& 
First app I feel an obligation to evaluate and give 5 stars ...! &&*%*&& 
This new version was very good application. I recommend! &&*%*&& 
No iPad platform? Terrible. &&*%*&& 
This app is good. Better than most mail apps. But far inferior to the native iOS mail. I fail to see the need for this yahoo mail client. The native app benefits from iOS push notification, which are near instant as well as the notification center. It allows the user to see and access his custom folders and do almost everything he can from a PC browser. &&*%*&& 
Their needs to be a way to easily delete spam &&*%*&& 
Not every network allows access to my emails through my iphone mailbox.  This is the perfect app that I have been waiting for. I can always access my yahoo mail easily without any restrictions on networks that I am connecting to. &&*%*&& 
This app is great. I just wish it had an option for VIP mail alerts like the iPhone mail app. If it did, I would give it 5 stars. &&*%*&& 
Great app.  A very good start &&*%*&& 
I finally succumbed to incessant pressure to install the damned thing even though I did not ask for it or want it. And I hate when Yahoo blocks the bottom section of iPhone formatted articles so that it is impossible to view the desktop version. It is okay I guess...but I hate HATE being badgered to download stuff I do not ask for. &&*%*&& 
Quick and easy to use! &&*%*&& 
Thanks yahoo for this app finally u decided to have a great app. Easy, simple and fast. &&*%*&&
