I've had to change the tone of my text messages, so I can tell which is which. I'm still getting confused when I hear the notification and think it's a text message.

Also, I love how the "delete all" option actually works. Maybe fix some crash glitches or freeze bugs, besides that.. Oh and when you reply to a message, it's kind of monotonous to press "show original" underneath the email you're typing to remember what message you're replying to- I would love if there was a setting that you could just see exactly what you're replying to without pressing "show original" .
