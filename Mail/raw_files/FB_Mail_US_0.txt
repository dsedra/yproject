Follow-up: Yahoo! fixed the folders. The folders now update with new email via my filters and show notifications, something the native iPhone email app was Never able to do automatically and u had to manually update EACH folder for new mail. Finally, I have a fully functional Yahoo! email app! I changed my rating from 1 star to 5 stars.'

Has anyone tried to open an attachment? Good luck. The one positive thing I can say about this app, and the Web UI for that matter, which I've used daily for the past 12 years, is it is consistent in its ability to be hobbled by obvious flaws that any software designer worth their salt would be embarrassed by. It's not like Email is a new design challenge after all. How Yahoo! continues to put out schlock like this with the resources at their disposal is amazing to me. Their laziness with design and usability continues to be a gift to their competitors.'

Well, the mail app can not do this, while the regular Yahoo app can.

Also, it doesn't allow your to search by "from", "to" or "subject" which I use all the time.

This app also does not have the feature.
