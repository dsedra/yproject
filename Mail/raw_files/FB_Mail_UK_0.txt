01-Feb-2013 :  2, 'PhilCutting' 'Good but not perfect' 'Having downloaded this app, I find I still prefer Mail. Yahoo mail is attractive and seems slightly faster at finding emails filtered into sub folders, but there's still a delay in retrieving mails after activating the app even though the notifications are there. Also, it's not possible to initiate a new mail by clicking on an email address in the body of the mail you're reading. Finally I don't like the way that the delete button works. Sliding your finger brings up a selection of actions to click but they completely hide the email header line. I'm worried I will delete the wrong email by mistake.  So, still some work to do then.'

When you prepare a birthday present and your email messages on the first screen of your iPhone. It is not really a surprise anymore.  Because your iPhone is on the main table of the living room. So please next upgrade in settings option: pop window: yes or no.'
