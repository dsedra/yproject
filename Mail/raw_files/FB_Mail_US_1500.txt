However the mail app's design in general is mediocre. For example you can't quickly delete mails in succession from mail view as the bar with the delete button is covered up after each delete. :/'

📌 But please note ( I've already went through it), but if you link your Yahoo email to another email address to have Yahoo forward your mail, you risk note actually logging into the original Yahoo Mail account. When that happens for more then 4 months, Yahoo will deactivate your email account for it being seen as inactive. So be careful not to lose all your Yahoo information because forwarding the emails does not register as you logging into Yahoo like you would hope.'
I recommend it.'
