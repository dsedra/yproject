Dec 24, 2012 :  1, 'Janay3md' 'Crashes Constantly' 'This would be a solid mail app if it wasn't for the bugs. It notifies you of mail faster than yahoo messenger, and has an easy to use interface. Unfortunately, it often crashes when loading and sends duplicates of the same email, sometimes repeatedly until the app is shut down and restarted again.  I've had to use it for an email alert to supplement apple's installed mail software because it is too unreliable to be used on its own. I have just uninstalled and am reinstalling the app to see if the problems improve. It's too bad - this has the potential to be a solid little mail app if the developers can address the crashing and multiple mail problems.'

I have to sign in/out of each one individually and for me that negates any advantage this app has over Apple's native Mail app. I'll keep it on my phone for they rare times I can't do something within Mail, as it's more convenient than logging in in the browser, but I doubt it'll get much daily use from me until this feature is added.'

Jan 11, 2013 :  4, 'adl218' 'Good start' 'This app is a good start, but I wish there was a way to limit what is shown on the lock screen.  It would be better if it just said 'new message' or something instead of showing who it's from and the subject.'
Dec 15, 2012 :  1, 'Useless version!' 'Released too early?' 'Should be a good app when the bugs are fixed. The visual display is pleasing, but phantom blank emails are sent when the app is opened, sometimes the app won't open and forwarded emails are sent up to five times.'

Jan 23, 2013 :  3, 'Mark Conner' 'A few bugs' 'Looks better than the iPhone mail app and receives mail ok but can't send for dome reason ?  Also says I have new email even after I have read and deleted all mail...will be five stars if/when these minor glitches are fixed.'

Feb 3, 2013 :  5, 'Geomongus' 'Great app' 'Great app, very easy to use. Would like it even better if I could access more than one account at once instead of having to log off and then back on again. Or if it were possible to have two yahoo apps.'
