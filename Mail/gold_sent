This app has definitely surprised me. Loads email very quick and it looks good! &&*%*&& pos
Good app easy, intuitive, q penalty boxes are duplicated. &&*%*&& both
No iPad platform? Terrible. &&*%*&& neg
I finally succumbed to incessant pressure to install the damned thing even though I did not ask for it or want it. And I hate when Yahoo blocks the bottom section of iPhone formatted articles so that it is impossible to view the desktop version. It is okay I guess...but I hate HATE being badgered to download stuff I do not ask for. &&*%*&& neg
Hello, can you add a support for more than one Yahoo! Account I have my self 3 that I want to use here &&*%*&& neut

Good app, easy to use. &&*%*&& pos 
Tha app sometimes does not open! It does as it would, but crashes and does not open. Sometimes it opens after 3 or 4 tries, but sometimes not: you need then to deinstall and install it again in order it opens again. I use an iPhone 4 with iOS 6.0.1. This must be corrected asap, please. &&*%*&& neg
Very proper application pity that I can not multiple accounts. &&*%*&& both
Thank you. &&*%*&& pos

...cant fault it so far. Very quick and easy. &&*%*&& pos
All good but how do you turn if the auto advice of a new message. Gets annoying beeping all the time every time a new message comes in! &&*%*&& both
this app can actually function as a mail app and can finally replace the mail app. &&*%*&& pos
Super like the app specifically the simplicity and appeal of the interface. Pls just add "mark/unmark all" so I dont have tick/untick items one by one. &&*%*&& both
very nice app &&*%*&& pos
Awesome job for creating this application. Its a friendly user app plus the appearance is very captivating. Easy to use and very enjoyable either you check your inbox, make an email reply or creating a new one. Its much better than IOS mail application installed originally in IOS products. Thank you and I really enjoy using this application. :) &&*%*&& pos
Easy to use &&*%*&& pos
I like it :) &&*%*&& pos
Smooth App!üëè &&*%*&& pos
Highly recommended to everybody. Though it doesnt have a tab for you to get back to your email once you press messenger, still its easy to navigate. &&*%*&& both

Good &&*%*&& pos
So much better and quicker at checking emails and deleting them! Love the notification you receive to let you know that you have mail! Means you dont have to keep checking your inbox unnecessarily! Top class app! Wouldnt be without it! 5* &&*%*&& pos
Smart application. Its fast but i get alerts on my locked screen even after signing out .... Scary. &&*%*&& both
Great app if your a yahoo user! &&*%*&& pos
Its a great app when it actually opens. &&*%*&& both
Best app ever &&*%*&& pos
Now checking my mail at the go became much more efficient. &&*%*&& pos
Its alot better than the orignal mail you get on the iPod and + it purple my fav color!! &&*%*&& pos
Excellent app. Great that it gives you access to all your mail and not just a 2 week period. &&*%*&& pos
Absolutely great app &&*%*&& pos
Really good work. Need search. &&*%*&& both
Not sure why I would use it above iPhones email account.  In particular, it cant handle multiple accounts. &&*%*&& neg
Great app for the first day. After that it didnt open just showed the home screen for a bit before crashing. &&*%*&& neg
Grate app &&*%*&& pos
its fast &amp; perfect and works just fine :) &&*%*&& pos
Could have more colour as white is bit "in yer face" not options to change it to a different colour. &&*%*&& neg
amazing &&*%*&& pos
Good app. Good to have access to all mail. &&*%*&& pos
Awful app, does not work at all :( &&*%*&& neg
Ok yahoo team what you can do better. Having options for pop up message to come up in the main screen. When you prepare a birthday present and your email messages on the first screen of your iPhone. It is not really a surprise anymore.  Because your iPhone is on the main table of the living room. So please next upgrade in settings option: pop window: yes or no. &&*%*&& neg
Great! &&*%*&& pos
Installed and worked without any problems. Seamless and easy to use. Highly recommend. Well done. &&*%*&& pos
Brilliant &&*%*&& pos
Very fast app! I will be using this instead of the one that comes prebuilt on iphone. &&*%*&& pos
The app is smooth on my iPhone 4, quick to load, and is now my default mail app since the ui fixes. &&*%*&& pos
Is so much better and easy to use love itüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç &&*%*&& pos
It was great when I first downloaded it but, as of late it takes me four to five times trying to open it for it to open - crashes almost immediately the first few times. &&*%*&& both
Very easy to use and I love the color of everything!!!!!! &&*%*&& pos
There are still lots of improvements to be made. The first thing that happened to me shortly after switching from the iPhone mail program to this is to lose my draft email. It suddenly disappeared altogether. &&*%*&& neg
Repeatedly crashes. Often wont load. Disappointing. &&*%*&& neg
I like the app but its been slow and now wont load up for almost a week now. Had to go back to using mobile browser. &&*%*&& both
I have no problem with the app. It took a long time to get here, but its fine. My problem is with Yahoos spam filtering. This last update allows you to bring items back from the spam folder... Because you will be moving so much spam into the folder you might accidentally need to recover non-spam, occasionally - get a gmail account. &&*%*&& both
This is a long needed app (the earlier yahoo all-in-one app was hairy). Just one bug makes me delete this. It ignores the iOS notification system. Even when I disable notifications, it jingles in the night when a new mail comes, as others have noted. Hopefully, they will fix this soon. &&*%*&& both
The interface is responsive, modern and intuitive. All user-created folders are available at the left (just swipe to open). Settings within the app and in iOS Settings app are complete without being overwhelming. Very nice. &&*%*&& pos
This is a great mail app. I would say its equal to if not better than the gmail app. I might just start switching all of my email over to Yahoo! Mail. &&*%*&& pos
The integrated mail function on my Iphone works a lot better.  The "new message" counter for the app does not work smoothly. &&*%*&& pos
So easy to use, great new features. &&*%*&& pos
I like this app...very convenient &&*%*&& pos
adding folders/mailboxes to archive to. otherwise, great update! love the photo attachment integration. people complaining about notifications: its the same as any app. go to your iPhone settings then notifications, and turn off everything but badges. &&*%*&& both
Works fine for me and I do enjoy using this app. &&*%*&& pos
Poor dont waste your time &&*%*&& neg
I love it &&*%*&& pos
Very cool, easy to use &&*%*&& pos
Without signing in and out. :( &&*%*&& neg
Easy to use, theres no confusion ... Very convenient . &&*%*&& pos
Doesnt load. Slow. I have deleted it after using it for less than 2 weeks &&*%*&& neg
love dis app &&*%*&& pos
A lot better to use than the email app that comes with the iPod touch. &&*%*&& pos
It works fine... Great app &&*%*&& pos
Great UI, runs quick, and includes features the generic iPhone mail app does not, but had to drop it since only one account can be configured.  Cmon Yahoo!? &&*%*&& both
Was working great for a week now it just sends notifications and mail wont load to open &&*%*&& both
I like but on my Straight Talk phone I can touch my name at top left and have option to switch between the two emails addresses. This app on IPhone/IPod I can not. Other than that I like new app and have had no problems. &&*%*&& both
Easy to use and very efficient!üì± &&*%*&& pos
Easy to use and overall its a good app. &&*%*&& pos
The new UI is very clean and easy to use. Very nice! &&*%*&& pos
Its good:-) &&*%*&& pos
I love this app its like a shortcut because I use to have to go on the Internet and get on my email &&*%*&& pos
Often wont any emails in the folders and cant turn off notifications. How this got past testing is beyond me. &&*%*&& neg
Works better than the mail app on the iPhone. &&*%*&& pos
Easy to use &&*%*&& pos
Very useful app. &&*%*&& pos
I love this new app especially on my iPhone . &&*%*&& pos
It does not delete mail &&*%*&& neg
When Im able to add a second account Ill give it the fifth star. Other than that its a great app. &&*%*&& both
iPhone version is far better.  Not worth downloading &&*%*&& neg
Love the interface. &&*%*&& pos
My pop acct screwed up... This works great &&*%*&& both
I realized I couldnt open attachments. Whats the point then? &&*%*&& neg
Keep giving us the good stuff! We like to be pleasantly surprise! Great app Internet king!!! &&*%*&& pos
PERFECT! thanks! *can actually send pictures! THANKSSS! &&*%*&& pos
So far &&*%*&& pos
I love this app, way better then apples built in email app, can delete your entire spam folder and select mail to trash much easier. only request is since all my emails are yahoo emails, it would be nice to be logged in to multiple accounts at one time. &&*%*&& neg
Not universal, doesnt support multiple accounts. I prefer the native iOS Mail app to this one &&*%*&& neg
I am quite happy with look but disappointed for not having folder showing in my mailbox. &&*%*&& both
Total crap....didnt transfer my email address. Have to keep old app. &&*%*&& neg
Great app. Updates made fantastic. &&*%*&& pos
This app is cool and it is awesome love üíñit I can check my messagesüì© were ever we go so I dont have to take my laptopüíª every were üòéüòãüòúüòùüòä &&*%*&& pos
When i send an email, the receipient only sees my email address instead of my name when they look at their inbox. There is no way to change this that I can find. &&*%*&& neg
Needs AirPrint support &&*%*&& neut
Great!!! &&*%*&& pos
Very easy , nise &&*%*&& pos
This by far is the most useful app I have come across. Thumps up to Yahoo! &&*%*&& pos
Usefull and fast &&*%*&& pos
My fav thing is being able to mark emails as spam. With the default mail application that comes with the iPhone you cant, with this you can. &&*%*&& pos
Does not alert me on my iPhone &&*%*&& neg
Notifications, clean looks and the speed meets my expectations. &&*%*&& pos
Works like a charm and I like that you can access messenger easily while in the app. &&*%*&& pos
I can not get the app to actually open. Ive been trying all day and it just closes down. When it finally opens, its so slow. Also i do not like the fact that it rings in as a text sound without any way to change it. I hAd to change my text sound because of it. &&*%*&& neg 
This app is awesome!!!!! &&*%*&& pos
Very good &&*%*&& pos
Easy to use &&*%*&& pos
Crashes every time I open it. &&*%*&& neg
Awesome &&*%*&& pos
Add the ability to have more than one account &&*%*&& pos
Excellent &&*%*&& pos
Since I have only one email, this works wonders for me!!!!(: &&*%*&& pos
Okay very simple and very practical and functional like me &&*%*&& pos
It is a good app and I love it is very good to have and to check you mail so yes it is a good app &&*%*&& pos
This app constantly crashes and the only way I have found to fix it is to completely remove it and reinstall it. It would be a great production app if it would work without crashing and freezing my phone. &&*%*&& both
Slow to check/download. Virtually forced to download the app because Yahoo put a lameass "Download the App" ad that popped up EVERY EFFING TIME I refreshed the browser. Downgrade from the browser based version. &&*%*&& neg
Worked great on day one but now the app crashes when I try to reply to emails. Hopefully v2 fixes the bug. &&*%*&& both
A lot better and faster than apples mail! Love it! &&*%*&& pos
Very happy with improvements! &&*%*&& pos
The edit function needs to be better, I dont like opening my mail before being allowed to delete junk!! &&*%*&& neg
Its good if you dont have a computer a laptop in reach or near you. But I had to uninstall it then reinstall it. Because it wouldnt open it kept on closing by itself. Please fix that issue and other problems what other people are having with this app. &&*%*&& both
Great &&*%*&& pos
This app is awesome! &&*%*&& pos
I really love this email app &&*%*&& pos
fast and simple solution to avoid IMAP setup in your iPhone settings &&*%*&& pos
Superb! &&*%*&& pos
Excellent!  Thanks!!! &&*%*&& pos
The app looks good and functions however there are a few bugs. There are double of each one of my folders in the side menu and there is an email that I am unable to delete. Also the app crashes every time I try to put an email into a folder. All this is on my iPhone 4S &&*%*&& both
The app will not open mp4 attachments. Worthless. &&*%*&& neg
The app isnt bad so far, but its missing the ability to edit your current email contacts. &&*%*&& both
This has been the best few days of geting emails for the first time I couldnt have done it without you YAHOO!!!! &&*%*&& pos
Very user friendly app still does the things I need &&*%*&& pos
Great new app....while it works and doesnt crash on me. I deleted and reinstalled and that seemed to work for a little while, until it started crashing again &&*%*&& both
There was a bug fix to resolve the move to folder feature. Ymail contacted me personally via social media and had me test the fix. Thank you ymail support for your promptness. &&*%*&& pos
Very very good &&*%*&& pos
Not Bad &&*%*&& pos
Everything works as they said it would. Great job. &&*%*&& pos
Great app...but please include option to link multiple yahoo emaim accounts. &&*%*&& both
I really like this app. I dont have to pull my hair out, to use it. &&*%*&& pos
Fast and responsive. So far so good. Need multi account support though. &&*%*&& both
Its good &&*%*&& pos
Title says it all. I hate Yahoo. &&*%*&& neg
A little confusing at first but once you get the feel of surfing; you can easy make your way through any area you want to view. &&*%*&& both
Ok &&*%*&& neut
Nice program with nice features &&*%*&& pos
Worst app ever I rather go through google to get toy mail,this friggen freezes so bad I wanna throw something &&*%*&& neg
Sick and tired of the new mail notifications popping up whenever. No way to turn it off. App DELETED! &&*%*&& neg
Totally awesome!! &&*%*&& pos
Pretty good; at least its better than the last version! &&*%*&& pos
And no photos smart folder :/:/ &&*%*&& neg
The delays between actions are a tad too long &&*%*&& neg
Pure Perfection &&*%*&& pos
This app wont even load mail, even with a strong wifi connection!! How did it take so long to create when it doesnt work?? &&*%*&& neg
Cant add or rename folders. Wth yahoo? Get back on the leading edge whydontcha. &&*%*&& neg
Hate this. Yahoo, Im about to change to gmail. &&*%*&& neg
Awesome! &&*%*&& pos
I like it, faster than the built in mail app. Be nice in future updates to support multiple accounts easier. &&*%*&& both

Very good app &&*%*&& pos
This great app  I did not expect Yahoo is going to spend time on, it nice, smooth, responsive and professional in use. Thank u yahoo &&*%*&& pos
Great if I need to just read my mail. Simple and to the point. &&*%*&& pos
Good &&*%*&& pos
It works great.  And much faster and more secure than the "old" web version. &&*%*&& pos
Is very good i like the app. &&*%*&& pos
Clean,fast. Huge improvements. &&*%*&& 
Great when it works. Crashes more than 90% of the time. &&*%*&& both
The notifications for emails come through but the app hasnt opened in days. Thinking about deleting and reinstalling. If that doesnt work its back to safari I guess &&*%*&& both
I want to like this, but it never opens. Not "intermittent crashes," it just doesnt open. Im giving it until 1/31, then its gone. &&*%*&& both
There is absolutely no function to mail app where you cant even access the folders of said mail client using their mail app. This app is as useful as having a remote control to your neighbors television &&*%*&& neg
How to sort &&*%*&& neut
Mail is easy to read and manage, except I cannot figure out how to create a new folder here.  Loading my mail from Safari was just as quick, so when I get short of memory, this will be one of the apps Ill have no problem deleting. &&*%*&& both
Gooooodd &&*%*&& pos
Thanks this is a great app, set up with bookmarks like fb so its easy to use! Now just stop posting dumb stuff on my yahoo home page like bebers new tat...? Who cares! ;) &&*%*&& both
Pretty worthless without the disposable addresses. &&*%*&& neg
Nice layout. It only worked twice. Hasnt opened in three days!!! Keeps crashing. &&*%*&& both
I was quite content with using the native iOS mail client to access my Yahoo mails but I have now switched that off and am using this app instead. This is by far the BEST way to manage my yahoo mails. Definitely rocks! &&*%*&& pos
Satisfactory! &&*%*&& pos
I downloaded this app a few days ago and already, Ive had my account hacked on two occasions! &gt;_&lt; &&*%*&& neg
Was great and loved it. Now can not open it for about 2 weeks.  When will this be fixed would love to get it again. Now its taking up space so I am deleting it. Two stars just for how great it was.  Would be five if it was still functional. &&*%*&& both
For making this app! Love it! Way better than native email app and a significant improvement over mobile yahoo email website! &&*%*&& pos
Great App. &&*%*&& pos
I think its awesome I love it for my iPhone no problems at all, now I want it for my iPad 2 please make it for the iPad ;) &&*%*&& pos
Its about time yahoo got with the program! Theres one bug that bothers me such as notifications do not go away after emails are read or deleted. However, unlike a lot of others complaints, all of my folders are accessible via the menu at the top left. Needs a little work yet, but its MUCH preferred over the Safari version! Thumbs up from me! &&*%*&& both
I like everything but the lack of control over notifications.  I dont want to hear every time  I get spam. &&*%*&& both
This is very nice app &amp; easy to use! I love Marisa Mayer! Keep up... &&*%*&& pos
Gr8 app, but still prefer the iPhone mail app &&*%*&& neg
