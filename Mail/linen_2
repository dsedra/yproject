Excellent app
Good APP with it you can access multiple accounts from Yahoo, with more facilities than the web, I recommend it.
It was time that was the will of yahoo mail for iOS, now you just need the yahoo answer on iOS!
User friendly. Can be faster to load.
Good enough. Not many bells or whistles but it works
Does the job
Just downloaded this app a few days ago and I am enjoying it.
Now it is perfect
Finally an app for Yahoo! Mail. Hopefully in your next update we can have it optimized for the iPad and support for multiple IDs
Excellent
Nothing to say, just spectacular

yahoo will make a comeback
Give you five
