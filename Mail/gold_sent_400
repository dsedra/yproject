An excellent application of e-mail, easy, lightweight, intuitive and fast! &&*%*&& pos
Good APP with it you can access multiple accounts from Yahoo, with more facilities than the web, I recommend it. &&*%*&& pos
While there is no possibility to mark several mails at once, you can not evaluate as well ... &&*%*&& neg
Fast and well structured! &&*%*&& pos

Very good this app, much better than the application of native email on the iPhone. &&*%*&& pos

First app I feel an obligation to evaluate and give 5 stars ...! &&*%*&& pos
This new version was very good application. I recommend! &&*%*&& pos
No iPad platform? Terrible. &&*%*&& neg
This app is good. Better than most mail apps. But far inferior to the native iOS mail. I fail to see the need for this yahoo mail client. The native app benefits from iOS push notification, which are near instant as well as the notification center. It allows the user to see and access his custom folders and do almost everything he can from a PC browser. &&*%*&& both
Their needs to be a way to easily delete spam &&*%*&& neg
Not every network allows access to my emails through my iphone mailbox.  This is the perfect app that I have been waiting for. I can always access my yahoo mail easily without any restrictions on networks that I am connecting to. &&*%*&& pos
This app is great. I just wish it had an option for VIP mail alerts like the iPhone mail app. If it did, I would give it 5 stars. &&*%*&& both
Great app.  A very good start &&*%*&& pos
I finally succumbed to incessant pressure to install the damned thing even though I did not ask for it or want it. And I hate when Yahoo blocks the bottom section of iPhone formatted articles so that it is impossible to view the desktop version. It is okay I guess...but I hate HATE being badgered to download stuff I do not ask for. &&*%*&& neg
Quick and easy to use! &&*%*&& pos
Thanks yahoo for this app finally u decided to have a great app. Easy, simple and fast. &&*%*&& pos
I think it is great &&*%*&& pos
Like it -makes it easier to access my mail &&*%*&& pos
Hello, can you add a support for more than one Yahoo! Account I have my self 3 that I want to use here &&*%*&& neut
I like it. Does what I need it to. &&*%*&& pos
Good enough. Not many bells or whistles but it works &&*%*&& both
Excellent mail app. Best Ive seen. &&*%*&& pos
I think think this app..is really great even though its Not an iPhone! It works great on the wifi ! &&*%*&& both
Works great! &&*%*&& pos
The app doesnt let you to choose different notification sound and the one that developers chose is very annoying and confusing. &&*%*&& neg
It took too long but worth it! I love the app, life saver &&*%*&& both
Didnt use it much because it only handles one email account at a time, and I have two. &&*%*&& neg
I still cant get it to work. All I wanted was to mark some mail as spam, but now Im in an even worse position than before. &&*%*&& neg
Does not have yahoo calendar. &&*%*&& neg
This app is great but please make it so i can use multiple accounts like the default mail app &&*%*&& both
Spam filtering is very lacking! It does not work very well. Shame Yahoo. &&*%*&& neg
This was long overdue. Downloaded it today and so far so good. No issues. Quite good interface. &&*%*&& both
Yahoo is number one....there work professional team . &&*%*&& pos
Keeps crashing all the time &&*%*&& neg
Great app.! &&*%*&& pos
Very basic features that rarely work! &&*%*&& neg
With web we easily access the calendar. With this apps the calendar is missing from the apps list. &&*%*&& neg
Does the job &&*%*&& neut
Just downloaded this app a few days ago and I am enjoying it. &&*%*&& pos
Its the best! But I wait to see best version of the best! &&*%*&& pos
Hmmm. So far not pleased with this app. "Failed to download message" is becoming a frequent notice. &&*%*&& both
I have used other mail apps but thus one is by far the best. &&*%*&& pos
I like it it is awesome. &&*%*&& pos
This is a great app.  Love the functionality.  Couldnt log-in on LTE, needed wifi.  Overall great! &&*%*&& both
No problems whatsoever. &&*%*&& pos
This app is awestruck! It really helped me keep up to date with my email! &&*%*&& pos
Good alternate app when corporate mail restriction in place. &&*%*&& pos
I like the yahoo mail app. The only problem I have is that all my folders in my inbox is in doubles-please fix it. Other than that its great to use. &&*%*&& both
It works great! &&*%*&& pos
Better than before &&*%*&& pos
Its great &&*%*&& pos
I wish the app would allow more than one yahoo mail to be set up on it. I have multiple yahoo mail accounts for different purposes. I wish I could manage them all in this app. &&*%*&& neut
A zero rating for me cant seem to get into my business account which is what I use. Have use the web browser to do it. &&*%*&& neg
No issue and I love it &&*%*&& pos
I love it. &&*%*&& pos
Dont like how it goes one way chronologically so if I mark one as unread, then delete the next one, it will then take me back to the unread one and I have to mark it as unread every time if I want that label to stay. Doesnt feel very intuitive. &&*%*&& neg
This app wont even open for me.  It works intermittently.  Im removing it! &&*%*&& neg
Good for iphone. Useless for ipad. Get on your horses. &&*%*&& both
Very good App for checking yahoo email &&*%*&& pos
Crashes (exits) immediately after start up, very unreliable. Yahoo!..very disappointing. &&*%*&& neg
Like it, long time was waiting for such app. &&*%*&& pos
Log on needs a remember me button not just go to my email right away. I like having the option to put it in or not. &&*%*&& neut
Now it is perfect &&*%*&& pos
Finally an app for Yahoo! Mail. Hopefully in your next update we can have it optimized for the iPad and support for multiple IDs &&*%*&& neut
I have to email add from yahoo but I can only view one account. &&*%*&& neut
Function-wise the app works well. I  able to organize my mail simply.  However, startup time until I actually see my listing of mail has greatly increased. I see the purple yahoo splash screen for at least 7 secs. Used to be 1 or 2. &&*%*&& both
I loaded this app to hopefully be able to mark certain emails as "not spam" so they would come to my inbox. No such luck. Please put that feature on here. &&*%*&& neg
I wish they had an option for remembering the user name, all we need to type is just the password only. &&*%*&& neut
After installing this app, someone hacked into my account and sent a bunch of emails to my contacts. I dont even know what was sent... Im so mad!!! Had to change everything!!! Dont install!!! &&*%*&& neg
crashes whenever I try to reply to an email. makes email font tiny. the other things LOOK good though. &&*%*&& both
it would be perfect if the log in section has "remember me" options &&*%*&& neg
...at least so far. I was having a lot of problems with Yahoo Mail in Safari, and havent yet experienced them with this app. &&*%*&& neut
Excellent &&*%*&& pos
Was excited about this app as I have not been able to access my yahoo mail for 2 months on my iPhone 5. However quite disappointed as I keep getting the "Authentication Failed" error message. Any solutions? &&*%*&& neg

Was great initially but now it wont open. It crashes all the time. Please fix the bugs!!! &&*%*&& both
Incorrect refreshed content &&*%*&& neg
The app looks nice, but Im now stuck in "All Contacts" and theres no way to escape and get back to my mailboxes. Ill uninstall and reinstall, but still - not a great first impression. &&*%*&& both
Would give zero stars if I could. Doesnt work ... Keeps showing incorrect number of emails unread and sporadically will not show current emails ... Basic stuff and they cant get it working - no wonder yahoo is a shadow of its former self &&*%*&& neg
Better then just having it as a mail but refreshing itself is not good &&*%*&& both
 &&*%*&& both
So far Im loving this app its much more cooperative than the mail ap that came on my cell originally and I have not had any problems with the services. &&*%*&& pos
Yahoo mail is the best email version I ever used better than others!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &&*%*&& pos

Tha app sometimes does not open! It does as it would, but crashes and does not open. Sometimes it opens after 3 or 4 tries, but sometimes not: you need then to deinstall and install it again in order it opens again. I use an iPhone 4 with iOS 6.0.1. This must be corrected asap, please. &&*%*&& neg

Great app. Easy to get around, attractive design &&*%*&& pos
The iPhone would have a brilliant and clean mail app. Why should I want to use an app with ads and a bad user experience instead? And why did this app get directly 5 times 5 stars? Hmm üôä &&*%*&& neg
Very handy when it works, but it freezes up every time you open the menu tab, only solution is to delete app and reinstall. &&*%*&& both
Love it &&*%*&& pos
If there was a minus 5 stars thats how bad I would rate this &&*%*&& neg
At last! This app has saved me time and made tapping easier &&*%*&& pos
This app worked quite well initially. It has a very nice interface and integrates seamlessly with yahoo webmail, without the annoyances of marking emails as read etc that comes with the native app. After a few weeks use, it is constantly crashing, which I presume is a memory issue. Needs a fix to continue using it. (3GS IOS 6.0.1). &&*%*&& both
Its works brilliantly and is good &&*%*&& pos
Great app! Its classy looking, it is easy to get to different folders and it is purple!!!! Great job! &&*%*&& pos
Regular and ongoing issues with crashing and app stability... I think Ill come back when bugs have been fixes. &&*%*&& neg
Finally .. Its an amazing app &&*%*&& pos
Finally a great app to manage Yahoo! Email and replace the native app. &&*%*&& pos
Great to use! I like &&*%*&& pos
Quite a surprise from Yahoo, who seem to have ignored the iOS for quite a while. This is a super clean, fast and easy to use application, and I think one of the better third party web mail apps out there for iPhone. &&*%*&& pos
