Yahoo mail is attractive and seems slightly faster at finding emails filtered into sub folders, but there's still a delay in retrieving mails after activating the app even though the notifications are there. Also, it's not possible to initiate a new mail by clicking on an email address in the body of the mail you're reading. Finally I don't like the way that the delete button works. Sliding your finger brings up a selection of actions to click but they completely hide the email header line. I'm worried I will delete the wrong email by mistake.  So, still some work to do then.'

Has anyone tried to open an attachment? Good luck. The one positive thing I can say about this app, and the Web UI for that matter, which I've used daily for the past 12 years, is it is consistent in its ability to be hobbled by obvious flaws that any software designer worth their salt would be embarrassed by. It's not like Email is a new design challenge after all. How Yahoo! continues to put out schlock like this with the resources at their disposal is amazing to me. Their laziness with design and usability continues to be a gift to their competitors.'

Well, the mail app can not do this, while the regular Yahoo app can.  The regular Yahoo app also complains every time I open e-mail and sugests that I get the far inferior mail app.  I have an idea: Stop trying to play catchup with Google, and make your own thing work great.  You folks have news, sports, so much to offer, but you try and force this crappy mail app on people.  Come on.  Do it right.'

This is a Yahoo app after all. It's like asking why I can't buy Pepsi from a Coke machine. Common sense people. Anyway, if you only have one Yahoo account, the app is worth the download.

Also, it doesn't allow your to search by "from", "to" or "subject" which I use all the time.

This app also does not have the feature.

Oh and when you reply to a message, it's kind of monotonous to press "show original" underneath the email you're typing to remember what message you're replying to- I would love if there was a setting that you could just see exactly what you're replying to without pressing "show original" .

I was excited to get a Yahoo! mail app that had notifications, but this one is terrible, about as bad as the actual Yahoo! app. If you delete multiple emails then leave the app, they're still there. You have to wait at least 10 seconds for them to delete before leaving the app. It also says that I have 1 unread email, but I've refreshed the inbox and force closed the app, but it still says it.'

The features are great and it's easy to scroll through and delete large amounts if mail quickly. The problem is that it crashes. I successfully opened the app once, then every time I tried after that, it gets stuck on the purple screen forever then crashes, never even opening at all for me. I uninstalled then reinstalled the app after that. It worked for a day and now it's doing the same thing it did before. It's really not worth the trouble to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and trying time after time to open the app when it won't even open at all! Would be a great app if I could open it!'

üìå But please note ( I've already went through it), but if you link your Yahoo email to another email address to have Yahoo forward your mail, you risk note actually logging into the original Yahoo Mail account. When that happens for more then 4 months, Yahoo will deactivate your email account for it being seen as inactive. So be careful not to lose all your Yahoo information because forwarding the emails does not register as you logging into Yahoo like you would hope.'
I recommend it.'

Unfortunately, it often crashes when loading and sends duplicates of the same email, sometimes repeatedly until the app is shut down and restarted again.  I've had to use it for an email alert to supplement apple's installed mail software because it is too unreliable to be used on its own. I have just uninstalled and am reinstalling the app to see if the problems improve. It's too bad - this has the potential to be a solid little mail app if the developers can address the crashing and multiple mail problems.'

However, I have multiple accounts and I use them all frequently, and this app can't handle them simultaneously. I have to sign in/out of each one individually and for me that negates any advantage this app has over Apple's native Mail app. I'll keep it on my phone for they rare times I can't do something within Mail, as it's more convenient than logging in in the browser, but I doubt it'll get much daily use from me until this feature is added.'

I can go on, for a start why does Yahoo MAIL loads in to a 'Top News' section? It's called fraud, misleading etc. And I can go on. The point is you cannot force the few remaining Yahoo Mail users to like your other products, specially when they show up messed up on a mobile device or is just really annoying (I'm talking to you, Yahoo Omg).'
