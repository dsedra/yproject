Overview: This project is a Summer intern project at Yahoo! to attempt to extract meaning from user reviews. The goal was to apply sentiment analysis followed by classification to the reviews in an effort to reduce the amount of time required to understand the important trends in the data. To this end several software packages from diverse sources were used.
