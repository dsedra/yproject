I have used other mail apps but thus one is by far the best.
Good alternate app when corporate mail restriction in place.

Like it, long time was waiting for such app.
Finally an app for Yahoo! Mail. Hopefully in your next update we can have it optimized for the iPad and support for multiple IDs

fierce YES OK I A / C Lock Zo into complete information, the pop-up has been unlocked, then login, turned around and went to the first error point to know and bounced back msg, A / C Lock Zo. 
Always can load into the apps!
than before, better and faster, clear easy to use! 
than the Gmail app easy to use, but the fly in the ointment is only one account can log in, and hope that the next version supports multi-account login. 
More better then icloud
Good, but can handle only one account
Nice Apps but cant download any attachment and edit forward any email
Ready to try
This app is good but not support multiple account, please update
Its good but I cant download mail with pic attachments. Pls fix it.. Pleaseeee.. Thank you so much :)
