Very good this app, much better than the application of native email on the iPhone.
App pleasant and quick!
This app has definitely surprised me. Loads email very quick and it looks good!
Great app! Loads e-mail faster than mail, easier to navigate between folders...
who would say, pleasantly surprised.
First app I feel an obligation to evaluate and give 5 stars ...!
This new version was very good application. I recommend!
Not every network allows access to my emails through my iphone mailbox.  This is the perfect app that I have been waiting for. I can always access my yahoo mail easily without any restrictions on networks that I am connecting to.
This app is great. I just wish it had an option for VIP mail alerts like the iPhone mail app. If it did, I would give it 5 stars.
I think it is great
Like it -makes it easier to access my mail
I like it. Does what I need it to.
Excellent mail app. Best Ive seen.
I think think this app..is really great even though its Not an iPhone! It works great on the wifi !

It took too long but worth it! I love the app, life saver
This app is great but please make it so i can use multiple accounts like the default mail app
Great app.!
Its the best! But I wait to see best version of the best!
I have used other mail apps but thus one is by far the best.
I like it it is awesome.
This is a great app.  Love the functionality.  Couldnt log-in on LTE, needed wifi.  Overall great!
This app is awestruck! It really helped me keep up to date with my email!
Good alternate app when corporate mail restriction in place.
I like the yahoo mail app. The only problem I have is that all my folders in my inbox is in doubles-please fix it. Other than that its great to use.
It works great!

These cool because it avoids taking the option mail
Really great app for yahoo mail !!!

5 Star!
fierce YES OK I A / C Lock Zo into complete information, the pop-up has been unlocked, then login, turned around and went to the first error point to know and bounced back msg, A / C Lock Zo. 
Like creating new folders, log-in and fast switch between multiple accounts.
than before, better and faster, clear easy to use! 
than the Gmail app easy to use, but the fly in the ointment is only one account can log in, and hope that the next version supports multi-account login. 
More better then icloud
