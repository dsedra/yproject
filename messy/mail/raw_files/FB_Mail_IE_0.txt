13-Dec-2012 :  1, 'Cork2010' 'Useless' 'App doesn't seem to refresh external mail as can be done on web version. Renders the app useless to anyone using yahoo mail with external email account'

12-Dec-2012 :  1, 'Mongobaer' 'Why?' 'The iPhone would have a brilliant and clean mail app. Why should I want to use an app with ads and a bad user experience instead? And why did this app get directly 5 times 5 stars? Hmm ðŸ™Š'

26-Dec-2012 :  2, 'Evil_Teddy_Bear' 'Crashing after some use, but has potential' 'This app worked quite well initially. It has a very nice interface and integrates seamlessly with yahoo webmail, without the annoyances of marking emails as read etc that comes with the native app. After a few weeks use, it is constantly crashing, which I presume is a memory issue. Needs a fix to continue using it. (3GS IOS 6.0.1).'

13-Dec-2012 :  5, 'dkenny' 'Wow! Really tidy mail app!!' 'Quite a surprise from Yahoo, who seem to have ignored the iOS for quite a while. This is a super clean, fast and easy to use application, and I think one of the better third party web mail apps out there for iPhone.'
18-Dec-2012 :  1, 'Bradydman29' 'Not bad' 'Not to bad at all pointless haven a mail app on the phone now with this'
