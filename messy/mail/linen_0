Finally a great app to manage Yahoo! Email and replace the native app.
Quite a surprise from Yahoo, who seem to have ignored the iOS for quite a while. This is a super clean, fast and easy to use application, and I think one of the better third party web mail apps out there for iPhone.
Stable, good speed and view of content and browsing.
Excellent. Very easy to use. No need to log in through computer.
